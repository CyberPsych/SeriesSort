{"name":"Series Sort","tagline":"Organise your TV Series","body":"### Welcome to Series Sort.\r\nI created this project to play around with with some designs and methodologies that I was experimenting with.\r\nThe code is changing as I think of things or get ideas.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThis software is intended to help you organise your series files.\r\nYou can select a directory and the program will read through all the files in it an decide if they are valid TV series files. If they are valid episodes it adds the files by episode to the respective series.\r\nThe program can then move them to an organised directory structure.\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Directory Path for Episodes**\r\n\r\nLibrary_Path\\Series Name\\Season 0n\\Series Name S0nE0n.extension \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Driven Development (TDD)\r\nThis project is Test Driven. i.e. Before functionality can be added, a test is created for that functionality.\r\nI am using the idea of \"Red, Green, Refactor\" which can be found at James Shore's site here:\r\n[http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is a project by Colin Genricks (@cyberpsych). However please feel free to contact me if you would like to work on the content, make suggestions or contribute.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
